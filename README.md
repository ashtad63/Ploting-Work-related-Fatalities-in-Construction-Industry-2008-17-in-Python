# Ploting Work-related Fatalities in Construction Industry (2008-17)

incurring a fatal work injury for workers in a given industry expressed as the proportion of fatal injuries \
per total hours worked annually per 100,000 full-time equivalents (FTE) workers. This allows risks to be \
compared among different industries.
